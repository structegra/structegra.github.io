With over 15 years of experience in the IT industry, I have gained a diverse background through various roles held in different organizations, such as software engineer, project manager, and enterprise architect.

My focus is on designing software development and IT processes, applying agile methods, analyzing IT landscapes, planning software and integration architectures, for example for individual software or ERP solutions.

I have two degrees from the Vienna University of Technology in computer science and computer science management. As co-founder and chairman of the [digital.austria]({{< relref "/projects/coderdojo" >}} "CoderDojo") association as well as [Youth Hackathon](https://youthhackathon.com/) Ambassador I am also engaged to the promotion of young IT talents.

I am dedicated to delivering exceptional service to my clients, ensuring that I help them achieve their goals through effective consulting and training. Contact me today to learn more about how I can assist you with your needs.
