## Who am I

I have been working at the intersection of technology, organization, and strategy for over fifteen years. During this time, I have worked as a software engineer, project manager, enterprise architect, and strategic consultant in various industries and organizational forms—from international corporations to public institutions to medium-sized companies.

What has always guided me in this work is clarity, substance, and the desire to make digital decisions well-founded and sustainable in the long term.

## What distinguishes me

I combine technical depth with strategic thinking and a clear eye for structures. Whether it's digital strategy, system and web architecture, information architecture, development processes, or tenders, my focus is always on providing guidance and developing solutions that fit the reality of an organization.
I work analytically, precisely, and based on principles. Open standards, sustainable architectures, and low-risk decisions are my key guiding principles.

## Education and social commitment

I completed two degrees at the Vienna University of Technology: Computer Science and Computer Science Management (with honors). Prior to that, I graduated from HTL Leonding in the *IT and Organization* department (with honors).

In addition to my professional activities, I have been committed to promoting young IT talent for many years. As co-founder and chairman of the association [digital.austria]({{< relref "/projects/coderdojo" >}} "CoderDojo") and as ambassador of the [Youth Hackathon](https://youthhackathon.com/), I support children and young people in finding access to the digital world in a playful and creative way.

## How I work

I support organizations with clarity, structure, and a deep understanding of technical, organizational, and human contexts. My work is characterized by transparency, analytical precision, and the desire to enable sustainable decisions.

I do not work for short-term effects, but for long-term orientation.
