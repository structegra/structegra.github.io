It creates clarity, makes risks visible, and enables decisions that carry weight. I consciously work without artificial narratives or staging; substance is not created by slides, but by models that stand up to the reality of a company—its systems, dependencies, and people. I prefer clarity over complexity fog and structure over actionism. Good architecture is not decoration, but a foundation that works in the long term and enables responsibility. That\u0026rsquo;s why I reject “marketing architecture”: models that are meant to impress but don\u0026rsquo;t support anything. What matters is not how something looks, but whether it facilitates decisions and makes risks transparent.\nMy work always begins with a precise analysis of the existing situation. I identify patterns, structural problems, and systemic connections—not just symptoms. In collaboration, I focus on openness and equality: architecture is not created in an ivory tower, but in dialogue with the people who will later have to support it. An essential part of my work is to pass on knowledge and empower teams to make better decisions independently.\nCompanies that value substance over buzzwords will find in me a partner who takes responsibility, provides guidance, and consistently thinks in terms of solutions. I work for organizations that are not looking to be impressed, but rather to move forward.\n","date":"Thursday, February 12, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/page/principles/","section":"Pages","summary":"","title":"Principles and Methods","type":"page"},{"content":" Topics # I can advise you on your questions regarding\nEnterprise architecture management Software and solution architecture IT consulting Coaching and trainings for IT professionals and software engineer IT processes and governance Project management project support, project steering comittee Advice on tenders Partner search and choice Training and Workshops # Selected topics of recent workshops:\nOAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect fundamentals\nOAuth 2.0 \u0026amp; OpenID Connect (almost) self-made with IdentityServer\nAuthNZ für APIs und Web-Apps mit IdentityServer\nSoftware project and portfolio management with GitLab, JIRA \u0026amp; Confluence or other tools\nVersion Control with Git\nGitLab GitHub Azure DevOps Bitbucket Partnerships # Partner im Expertennetzwerk www.IT-Visions.de GitLab Open Partner logo ","date":"Monday, January 2, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/offering/offer/","section":"Offerings","summary":"","title":"Services \u0026 Offer","type":"offering"},{"content":" Talks and Workshops # Overview of my recent and upcomming public talks and workshops\nMAD Summit München 2024 , \u0026nbsp;June 10, 2024 OAuth 2.0 und OpenID Connect: Schlüssel zur sicheren Authentifizierung Munich, Germany BASTA!
